Title:
Analyzing Movies Using Phrase Mining

Abstract:
Movies are a rich source of human culture from which we can derive insight. Previous work addresses either a textual analysis of movie plots or the use of phrase mining for natural language processing, but not both. Here, we propose a novel analysis of movies by extracting key phrases from movie plot summaries using AutoPhrase, a phrase mining framework. Using these phrases, we analyze movies through 1) an exploratory data analysis that examines the progression of human culture over time, 2) the development and interpretation of a classification model that predicts movie genre, and 3) the development and interpretation of a clustering model that clusters movies. We see that this application of phrase mining to movie plots provides a unique and valuable insight into human culture while remaining accessible to a general audience, e.g., history and anthropology non-experts.
